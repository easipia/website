<p>The East Asia Section of Inverse Problems International Association (IPIA) was initiated by Professor Gunther Uhlmann (University of Washington and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology) and Professor Jun Zou (The Chinese University of Hong Kong) during a conference on Inverse Problems, Imaging and PDEs that was held in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, September 28-October 2, 2015. This conference was also regarded as the first annual meeting of the East Asia Section of IPIA. <br><br>The East Asia Section of IPIA was officially established in October 2015. The Section aims to provide an active exchange platform for researchers working on inverse problems in the East Asia region, especially for young scholars. After some consultations and discussions&nbsp;among active researchers in this region, the first executive committee of The Section was formed by Professor Jun Zou (President, The Chinese University of Hong Kong), Professor Jenn-Nan Wang (Vice President, National Taiwan University), Professor Bo Zhang (Vice President, Chinese Academy of Sciences) and Professor Hongyu Liu (Secretary, City University of Hong Kong).
