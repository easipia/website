<h2 class="_level1_page_">Young Scholar Symposium</h2>
<p>The symposium is organized once or twice each year. Each symposium is approximately for two days.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, The East Asia Section of IPIA has organized a series of activities in a continuous manner, including the annual workshops “East Asia Section of IPIA - Young Scholar Symposium”. This series of symposia aims to promote young scholars working on inverse problems in the East Asia region.&nbsp; The symposia also provide a platform for active young researchers to exchange ideas and research results with their peers as well as leading experts from the East Asia region and to explore opportunities for research collaborations.&nbsp; The East Asia Section of IPIA will select and award one distinguished young researcher for "East Asia Junior Scholar Award" at each “East Asia Section of IPIA - Young Scholar Symposium”. This award started from 2017 and three awards were issued in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
